Exam Conditions: 
There   is no timer for this test. You can take the test over several days   in   separate working sessions. Save (but not submit yet) when you finish a working session   so   your   answers   are   there when you click again on the same   link at   your   next   session;   if you   accidently   submit there   is no possibility to   reconnect   to   the   test.
It   is an open book unsupervised assignment.   It   is an individual assessment. Collaboration is NOT permitted. 
The files to   upload   require hand-written answers; all diagrams,   balance sheet and/or equations as well as your full name and student   number at   the   top   of the   answer absolutely   need to be hand-written.   Ipads can be   used   to   produce   hand-written   answers.   You   are allowed to type the   part of the answers that   is   only   text.
Scan your exam answers for a given question, merge   them   if there are   more   than   one   page   for the answer and   upload them as one pdf document per question. Sending files by email is NOT permitted. 
Materials you need: 
Several sheets of paper, if possible without lines,   to write   your   official   answer.
Rough paper to draft your answers   before you copy   it   on the   actual   paper   you   will   upload
A   black pen and   possibly   blue and   red pens for your flow of fund diagrams   (avoid   using pencil on your official answer   as   not   easy   to   read)
A   calculator.
A   device   to   take   picture   of   your   handwritten   answers   and   convert   them   into   a   pdf   file.   You can also   include your pictures   into a word document   and   convert   it   to   a   pdf file.
If you do not   have access to a flatbed scanner, you   can   use   a   phone   app   such   as   “Adobe   Scan” or “Microsoft Office   Lens”   .
You can also answer with an   ipad and create   a   pdf directly from   the   ipad.
Resources to study: 
All resources available on the course   Bb and   UQ   Extend   platform   (self study,   tutorial, workshop and further training) and   in the assessment folder (revision online   quiz   on   topic   0,   1   2 and 3).   It   is   not   recommended to use external   resources that   have   not   been validated   by the course coordinator as they   may   be conflicting the approach we   take   in   the   course.
Weight in the final mark: 
The take   home assignment #1   is 20% of the final   mark.   It   is marked out of 40 marks in total   meaning that we will need to divide the   result by   2 when   calculating the   final   grade.
Structure of the assignment: 
The first take home assignment content is   worth 40 marks (we will   divide   the   result   by   2   when   calculating   the   course   final   mark).
Part A   10 marks. Answer   10   Multiple Choice Answer Questions
Part   B 20 marks. Solve   2   problems   B1   and   B2.
Upload a   pdf file of your hand-written answers for each
Part C   10   marks. Answer 2 questions. C1 is   a   true-false-unclear   statement   to justify   in details; C2   is a critical thinking question, on   an   unseen   context,   often   supported   by   an   article. 
See the expectations and the   marking standards at the end   of the   document.
Late submission and Extensions: 
A penalty of 4 marks (10% of total) will be deducted per day for   up   to   7   calendar   days,   at which   point any submission will   not   receive any   marks unless an   extension   has   been   approved.   Each 24 hour block   is recorded from the   time   the   submission   is   due. 
There   is NO deferred option.   Extensions will   not exceed 7 days   in any   case   and   will   require   solid objective evidence.
Requests for the granting of extensions must be   made   online   via
https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and- assessment/applying-extension?p=2#2 
with supporting documentation before the submission date and time.   [If you wait the   last minute to apply you may find out that the   application was   rejected   and   you   will   incur   penalties   for late submission.]    Requests   by email to   the   course   coordinator   are   NOT   valid.   It   is   a   good      idea, however, to notify your lecturer to the   course   email [email   protected]that you   have lodged a   request. 
Other penalties: 
Entirely typed uploaded answers will   incur a penalty of 30% of the marks for the question on the ground that the marker cannot check   authorship;   balance   sheets   and diagrams that are   not hand- written will   incur a penalty of 10% of the marks allocated to them. 
Please do   NOT upload word document or pictures format. A penalty of 10% of the marks for the question will apply for each file that has not a pdf format.
Please do   NOT   merge all your answers for all questions   in one single   pdf. A penalty of 10% of the marks for the question will apply for each file that   merges answers   of   several   questions. 
If files are missing or if they are the wrong ones when   you   submit   then   you   will   get   0   mark   for the question. Files sent by emails will be ignored. Submit late   rather than   sending files         by   email.
You will lose marks for   some good parts of your answer   if other   parts   of the   answer contradict or are inconsistent with your good explanations and/or give evidence   that   you   had actually not understood the question. 
Misconduct procedures will take   place and penalties decided by the Integrity team will apply if you are caught collaborating with others,   regardless of whether you are the student helping someone else or the student   receiving   help.   It   is   also   inacceptable to   use companies that s代 写ECON3210 Financial Markets and Institutions Summer Semester 2024Matlab

Technical issues: 
It   is your responsibility to take the assignment in   a   location where the Internet is stable (check   regularly that you are still connected) and   have a   plan   B   available   if your   Internet fails (like   having arranged with a   neighbour to use their internet   in   case of   emergency).   If you   have any doubt, change   location (go to   UQ campus for   instance);   provided   you   have   not   submitted you will be able to   reconnect to your test. 
If the system does not want to save your answers, (you   receive   a   message   of error that   it         does not save) you need to shut down completely your computer (DO NOT SUBMIT THE TEST YET) and   reconnect to your test that will still be   running. After checking that   all   the answers are saved and that the files are   uploaded, you   can   use the   remaining   time,   if   any left, to check your Mcq and your answers   located   in   answer   boxes.   It   is   highly   recommended   that during the   last   15 minutes of the test you do   NOT touch the   files   uploaded. 
For technical   help contact AskUs preferably by chat during   business   hours; the service   closes at 5pm on Saturday and Sunday   and   reopens   at   8am   on   Monday.

Expectations and marking standards: 
PART A 
Each question   is worth   1marks.   (10 Marks Total)
10 MCQ, covering topic 0 to 3 
Same   nature and   level of difficulty as questions   in   practice online tests.
Only one answer is correct. Choose the answer that   is   correct   in   most   cases.   Disregard
answers that would be   true only under very specific   circumstances   that were   not   specified   in   the question.
Be aware of the occasional presence of   NOT correct   in the   question!   If you   find   more   than   one correct answer, check   if you   have not overlooked   a   NOT   correct   in the   question.
PART B 
Answer each question in a separate   paper that you   upload   as pdf,   as   indicated   for   each   question.   Marks are as indicated. (20 Marks Total) 
2 problems covering topics 0 to 3 (B1 and B2) 
Questions   have several subquestions and can   mix   up topics.
Same   nature and   level of difficulty as   problems seen in tutorials   and workshops.
The questions are different from the ones   in the   tutorials.   Be   careful   not to   be   too
mechanical   in answering the exercises.   Personal abbreviations that were   not   used   in the   learning   resources are not accepted.
You are expected to define the concepts you use, provide formula before plugging 
numbers, show the details and ALL steps of your calculations, make explicit the 
reasoning you follow and interpret your result. Make sure that the interpretations are 
not simply a repetition of the result. This is part of good writing standards and evidence of a deep level of understanding as opposed to mechanical study. 
If you are afraid to be short of time   or to   be short   of energy   (more   likely   in   a   no-timer
assessment), write short answers first and leave some   space to   add   definitions,   explanations   and   interpretations later when you   have some time/energy   left.
Warning: consistency with   previous mistakes will   not always be   rewarded   (especially   if they   take you back too close to existing   model answers   of   problems   in   UQ   Extend).
PART C 
Answer questions   in separate   paper to upload as pdf file, as   indicated.   Marks   are   as   indicated. (10 Marks Total) 
This   part of the exam   puts a strong emphasis on critical   thinking,   ability   to   apply   knowledge   to   new contexts, the depth of understanding and   quality of writing.
Your answer must be well presented, with logical links between sentences. Messy 
answers and argumentation with parts presented in a wrong order or repetitive will be penalised. Be precise. Define the key concepts involved in the question. Vague 
explanations will not gain full mark. Refrain from writing on aspects not relevant to the question. Off topic components are evidence that the question was not fully 
understood and therefore will be penalised. You may not get marks for some good 
explanations if other parts of the answer contradict them and/or give evidence that you had actually not understood at all the key concepts. Therefore, do not gamble: only 
write information that you are convinced is correct. You should avoid google or other search engine as well as AI it is likely that the information you will find will not be 
precise enough for the course and/or fall in the trap of the misconception that the 
course precisely tries to debunk. Copying/paste slides contents is not acceptable as 
this does not give evidence that you have understood the content. Refrain using contents from your other courses as markers will look for answers reflecting 
exclusively what has been covered in this course. 
1 question (C1) to discuss 1 statement covering topics 1 to 3. (3 marks) 
You need to conclude whether   a statement   is true (always correct with   no   further
condition/restriction) false (always   incorrect given the case provided) or unclear (could   be
correct   under certain circumstances to be defined and   incorrect   under other   circumstances   to   be   defined).
You then   need to justify your answer   in four to six explanatory sentences. Without an
explanation or with a completely unrelated explanation you will get   0   marks   even   if your
conclusion true false or unclear was correct.   Be careful that unclear means that   if   it   true   in
some circumstances that   need to be defined   in your answer and false   in   other   circumstances   that also need to be defined   in your answer;   one   cannot   get   marks   for   unclear   by   simply
saying that the question was incomplete or   badly written!
1 question (C2) of critical thinking not covered in the learning resources related to topics 1 to 3. (7 marks) 
The question applies the concepts studied   in the   course   in an   unseen   context.   It   could   take   the form. of interpreting and commenting an extract from   an   article   or   some   new   data.
Part C is really the discriminatory part of the exam (with   the   explanations   and interpretations given   in   B too) therefore students aiming for a 7   need to   perform. well   on   this   part.   It   is easier to secure   marks   in   Part A and   B than   in   Part   C.
